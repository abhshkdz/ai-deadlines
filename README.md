## Conference Deadlines

Countdown timers to keep track of a bunch of conferences of interest to me.

## Adding/updating a conference

* Fork the repository
* Update `_data/conferences.yml`
* Make sure it has the `name`, `year`, `id`, `link`, `deadline`, `date` and `place` attributes (and optionally `timezone`; default is Eastern Time)
* Send a pull request
